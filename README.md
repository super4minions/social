## Facebook is a small website for registration (sign up and login), display profile for user, store and retrieve data from database

## our project allows the user to create a new account , and check by email if the user already exist or not, if the user already registered, the website will display a message telling him (you have an account in website) , if he a new user, it will store user data in  the database

## When user login, it will check if a user name and password are identical, it will direct user to the profile page
